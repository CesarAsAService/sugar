# sugar

## what is it?
sugar is an css project that helps front-end developers and designers, 
providing a solid visual experience between different browsers by 
standardizing HTML objects render as it should be.

Its approach is based on a principle that every element must be a 
zero-margin and zero-padding by default. Every element must be free of 
guidelines about distances and spaces between any other element.
It also contains snippets of [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css), that healps to create a 
cross-browser consistent code.
