# sugar

## what is it?
sugar is an css project that helps front-end developers and designers, providing a solid visual experience between different browsers by standardizing HTML objects render as it should be.

Its approach is based on a principle that every element must be a zero-margin and zero-padding by default. Every element must be free of guidelines about distances and spaces between any other element. It also contains snippets of [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css), that helps to create a cross-browser consistent code.
It is compiled using [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), and the directory strucuture is divided in `src` and `dist` folders which contains the source and the release of the minified code.
